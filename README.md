# PunDate

This may well be the best dating website ever, if what you want is to guess the
dates of various events.

Or not. I wanted to learn a bit of
[Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29) and
[Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails), so I made this for
practice. It's not very good, the user interface is ugly, and it's probably
rather insecure.
